With 17 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets, he is one of the most decorated players in the game.</p>
<p>Bax is also known for his prowess at no-limit hold’em, a game variant that accounts for many of his bracelets. So it was no surprise when, during a break from the WSOP Main Event final table last year, he offered some advice to eventual runner-up, JL Bourg.</p>
<p>According to Bax, Bourg would have been best served folding on two occasions during their heads-up battle.</p>
<p>The first instance came early on in the match when Bourg held J♣J♥ against Bax’s A♦K♣. The flop came 2♥7♦9♥, giving Bax top two pair. The turn was the 3♦ and the river the 8♠, making trips for Bax. Had Bourg folded preflop, he would have avoided this beat and still been in the match.</p>
<p>The second instance came later on when Bourg held A♥Q♠ against Bax’s A♠4♥. The flop came K♥Q♦8♣, giving both players a pair of kings. The turn was the 4♠ and the river the 10♦, making quads for Bax. Had Bourg folded on this hand as well, he would have walked away with an even larger chip lead over Bax.</p>
<p>While there is always some risk involved when folding, these examples show just how important it can be to know when to fold in poker – especially heads-up play.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-pro’s-top-tips-When-to-fold-JL-Bourg"><a href="#Poker-pro’s-top-tips-When-to-fold-JL-Bourg" class="headerlink" title="Poker pro’s top tips: When to fold JL Bourg"></a>Poker pro’s top tips: When to fold JL Bourg</h1><p>Poker is a game of both luck and skill. The objective is to win money by betting on the value of your hand, which is composed of five cards. There are many different variants of poker, but all share some basic rules. In this post, we will discuss the concept of folding in poker.</p>
<p>When you are playing poker, you will be given two options: fold or call. Calling means that you are betting that your hand is better than the hand of the person who has bet. If you fold, then you are throwing away your hand and conceding the round. Why would you want to do this?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why you might want to fold in poker. The first reason is that you may not have a good hand. If your hand is weak, then it is not worth it to risk more money by calling. Another reason to fold is if there is a lot of money already in the pot. If the pot contains a lot of money and the odds are not in your favour, then it may be wise to fold and save your money for another round. Finally, you may want to fold if there is a chance that someone else has a better hand than yours. If the odds are against you and there is a high chance that someone else has a better hand, then folding may be the best option.</p>
<p>When should you fold in poker? There is no one definitive answer to this question; it depends on the situation. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you make the decision whether or not to fold. If your hand is weak, then folding is usually a good idea. Additionally, if there is a lot of money already in the pot or if someone else has a better hand than yours, then folding may be wise. By following these tips, you can improve your chances of winning at poker!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-fold-JL-Bourg-in-poker-like-a-pro"><a href="#How-to-fold-JL-Bourg-in-poker-like-a-pro" class="headerlink" title="How to fold JL Bourg in poker like a pro"></a>How to fold JL Bourg in poker like a pro</h1><p>In poker, folding is one of the most important skills to have. If you’re not sure when to fold, you’ll lose money in the long run. JL Bourg is a great player who knows when to fold and when to continue playing. Here are some tips on how to fold like a pro:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know the odds</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in folding like a pro is understanding the odds. If you know how likely it is that you’ll win or lose a hand, you’ll be able to make better decisions about when to fold. There are many online calculators that can help you figure out the odds for various situations.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Pay attention to your position at the table</li>
</ol>
<p>Your position at the table also affects your decision-making process. If you’re in early position, you’ll usually have to fold more hands than if you’re in late position. This is because there’s a greater chance that someone will raise in front of you if you’re in early position.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Watch other players’ behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not sure whether to fold or not, watch what the other players are doing. If they seem confident about their hand, they might be bluffing; but if they look unsure, they might be trying to get rid of their hand cheaply. By watching the other players, you can gain clues about what they might be holding.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use your chips wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes time to fold, don’t use up all your chips just because you’re afraid of losing them all. If you have 20 big blinds and decide to fold when there’s only an 8 big blind pot, you’re really only risking 2 big blinds by folding - so don’t be too afraid to let go of bad hands. On the other hand, if there’s a lot of money at stake, it might be worth risking more chips to see the flop or turn.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Know your opponent’s tendencies</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve been playing against someone for a while, you’ll start to get an idea of what kind of hands they like to play and which ones they’re likely to fold. Use this information to your advantage by playing stronger hands against them when possible.</p>
<h1 id="When-not-to-fold-JL-Bourg-in-poker"><a href="#When-not-to-fold-JL-Bourg-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="When not to fold JL Bourg in poker"></a>When not to fold JL Bourg in poker</h1><p>Many poker players are under the misconception that folding is always the best option. This is not always the case, and in some situations folding can be a costly mistake. In this article we will discuss when folding is not advised, specifically in the game of Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>One situation where folding is not advised is when you have a very strong hand. For example, if you are playing in a no limit game and you are holding a pair of aces, it is usually not advisable to fold. You have a very good chance of winning the hand, and if you fold now you may miss out on some valuable chips.</p>
<p>Another situation where folding is often unwise is when there is a lot of money in the pot. For example, if there are five players at the table and $200 has been bet into the pot, it may be wise to fold if your hand is not particularly strong. The reason for this is that you stand to lose a lot of money if you lose the hand – more than you would if the pot was smaller.</p>
<p>Finally, another time when folding may not be ideal is when there are few cards left in the deck that could help improve your hand. For example, let’s say you are playing with two other players and there are only three cards left in the deck. If you have two tens and one other player has two sevens, it is probably not wise to fold – even though your chances of winning may not be great.</p>
<h1 id="The-right-time-to-fold-JL-Bourg-in-poker"><a href="#The-right-time-to-fold-JL-Bourg-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="The right time to fold JL Bourg in poker"></a>The right time to fold JL Bourg in poker</h1><p>The game of poker is all about making calculated decisions and folding at the right time can often be the difference between winning and losing. JL Bourg has been one of the most consistent players on the live poker circuit in recent years, but he has also been known to fold a hand or two when he should have stuck with it.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to take a look at some of the key hands that JL Bourg folded at the right time and discuss the reasons why it was the right decision.</p>
<h1 id="The-first-hand-we-are-going-to-look-at-is-a-Kings-Up-situation-against-an-opponent-who-had-just-raised-preflop-Bourg-3-betted-with-Aces-and-then-called-all-in-on-the-flop-when-his-opponent-shoved-The-turn-and-river-were-both-blanks-and-Bourg-took-down-the-pot"><a href="#The-first-hand-we-are-going-to-look-at-is-a-Kings-Up-situation-against-an-opponent-who-had-just-raised-preflop-Bourg-3-betted-with-Aces-and-then-called-all-in-on-the-flop-when-his-opponent-shoved-The-turn-and-river-were-both-blanks-and-Bourg-took-down-the-pot" class="headerlink" title="The first hand we are going to look at is a Kings-Up situation against an opponent who had just raised preflop.

Bourg 3-betted with Aces and then called all in on the flop when his opponent shoved.

Had he hit one of his two Aces, he would have lost a large portion of his stack.</p>

If he hit one of his Kings, he would have won, but there was a very high chance that he would lose against two opponents.</p>
