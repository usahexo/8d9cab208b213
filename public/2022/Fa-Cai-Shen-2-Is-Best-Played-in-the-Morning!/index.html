<h1 id="The-Best-Time-To-Play-Fa-Cai-Shen-2-Is-Early-In-The-Day"><a href="#The-Best-Time-To-Play-Fa-Cai-Shen-2-Is-Early-In-The-Day" class="headerlink" title="The Best Time To Play Fa Cai Shen 2 Is Early In The Day"></a>The Best Time To Play Fa Cai Shen 2 Is Early In The Day</h1><p>Fa Cai Shen 2 is an immensely popular Chinese lottery game that can be played both online and through physical outlets. The game is based on the drawing of numbers and has a number of different prize levels, with the top prize being 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways to play Fa Cai Shen 2, but the most common is to choose six numbers between 1 and 49. Tickets can be purchased for anywhere from one to ten games, and players can either choose their own numbers or have the machine randomly generate them for them.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to match as many of your chosen numbers as possible with those drawn. Prizes are awarded for matching two, three, four or five out of six numbers, with the odds of winning increasing with each matched number.</p>
<p>The best time to play Fa Cai Shen 2 is early in the day when there are more chances of winning smaller prizes. This is because the later in the day it gets, the more likely it is that all six winning numbers will have been drawn, meaning that there are no prizes left to be won.</p>
