                <h1>Ligue1 Casino's Protest Likely to Fall on Deaf Ears</h1>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Ligue1-Casino’s-Protest-Likely-to-Fall-on-Deaf-Ears"><a href="#Ligue1-Casino’s-Protest-Likely-to-Fall-on-Deaf-Ears" class="headerlink" title="Ligue1 Casino’s Protest Likely to Fall on Deaf Ears"></a>Ligue1 Casino’s Protest Likely to Fall on Deaf Ears</h1><p>The big news in French football this week has been the Ligue1 casino’s threatened strike over a proposed overhaul of the league’s financial rules. The strike, scheduled for this coming weekend, appears to have little chance of succeeding, however, as the league’s president has already stated that the new rules will be going ahead as planned.</p>
<p>The Ligue1 casino’s are protesting against a new rule that will cap their spending at 70 million euros per season. The casinos argue that this limit will impede their ability to compete with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco, both of whom are backed by billionaires who can afford to spend freely on players.</p>
<p>League president Jean-Michel Aulas has defended the new rule, stating that it is necessary in order to ensure financial stability in French football. He also pointed out that the casinos have been given plenty of time to adjust to the new limit, as it was first proposed two years ago.</p>
<p>It is likely that the Ligue1 casino’s strike will fall on deaf ears, as Aulas has already stated his determination to see the new rule go ahead. However, the casinos’ protest may serve as a warning to other clubs in France that are considering challenging the league’s financial rules.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owners-Protest-Loss-Deduction-Elimination"><a href="#Casino-Owners-Protest-Loss-Deduction-Elimination" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owners Protest Loss Deduction Elimination"></a>Casino Owners Protest Loss Deduction Elimination</h1><p>A proposal by the Trump administration could see a change in how casino owners are able to write off their losses.</p>
<p>Casino owners have been quick to voice their displeasure at the proposed changes, which would do away with the ability to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income.</p>
<p>The proposed changes are part of a larger overhaul of the US tax code, and would see the amount of allowable deductions slashed from $US3 trillion to $US2 trillion.</p>
<p>While there is broad support for the changes, as they aim to reduce the overall tax burden on American citizens, casino owners say that the loss deduction is crucial in allowing them to stay in business.</p>
<p>Las Vegas casino owner Steve Wynn said that without it, many casinos would go out of business. &quot;You cannot operate a major casino in this country without being able to offset your losses against your winnings,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s not feasible.&quot;</p>
<p>Wynn went on to say that if the changes were to be implemented, it would be akin to &quot;the government declaring war on gambling.&quot;</p>
<p>Other casino owners have echoed Wynn’s sentiments, with one saying that the proposals are &quot;catastrophic news&quot; for the industry.</p>
<p>The proposed changes come as US lawmakers look for ways to reduce the country’s mounting debt pile, which currently stands at over $US20 trillion.</p>
<h1 id="France’s-Ligue1-Casinos-Cry-Foul-Over-Loss-Deductions"><a href="#France’s-Ligue1-Casinos-Cry-Foul-Over-Loss-Deductions" class="headerlink" title="France’s Ligue1 Casinos Cry Foul Over Loss Deductions"></a>France’s Ligue1 Casinos Cry Foul Over Loss Deductions</h1><p>In what can only be viewed as a desperate attempt to claw back some of their losses, France’s Ligue1 casinos are crying foul over deductions being made from their winnings.</p>
<p>The French government has been busy over the past year enacting a number of legislation changes in an effort to bolster the country’s ailing finances. Included in these new laws is a measure that requires gambling establishments to pay taxes on their winnings, rather than just their revenues as was previous the case.</p>
<p>The casinos, predictably, aren’t happy with this development and have taken their grievances to court. They argue that the new tax regime is unconstitutional and unfairly targets them while leaving other forms of gambling (such as horseracing) untouched.</p>
<p>They also point out that, despite the new tax, they still face stiff competition from online gaming operators who don’t have to pay any taxes at all. This, they say, puts them at a disadvantage and undermines the fairness of the entire competitive landscape.</p>
<p>The government, for its part, counters that the new measures are necessary in order to bring in much-needed revenue and help finance important social programs. It also notes that online gaming is considered a form of illegal gambling in France and should be subject to taxation just like any other form of gambling.</p>
<p>It will be up to the courts to decide who is right and who is wrong in this dispute but one thing is for sure: it won’t be good news for the casinos whichever way it goes.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Operators-in-France’s-Ligue1-Lobby-Against-Removal-of-Gambling-Loss-Deduction"><a href="#Casino-Operators-in-France’s-Ligue1-Lobby-Against-Removal-of-Gambling-Loss-Deduction" class="headerlink" title="Casino Operators in France’s Ligue1 Lobby Against Removal of Gambling Loss Deduction"></a>Casino Operators in France’s Ligue1 Lobby Against Removal of Gambling Loss Deduction</h1><p>The gambling industry in France is lobbying against a proposed change to the tax code that would prevent them from deducting gambling losses from their taxable income. The proposed change was included in the country’s 2019 budget, which was submitted to the French parliament this week.</p>
<p>Casino operators in France’s top-flight football league, Ligue1, are leading the charge against the proposed change. Many of these casinos are owned by or have sponsorship deals with Ligue1 clubs.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission of France (ARJEL), which is responsible for regulating the gambling industry in France, has voiced its support for the proposed change. ARJEL believes that the change would help to protect consumers from excessive gambling losses.</p>
<p>Casino operators argue that the proposed change would lead to job losses and reduced investment in France’s gaming industry. They also argue that it would make it more difficult for them to compete with online gambling operators.</p>
<p>Ligue1 president Jacques-Henri Eyraud has come out in opposition to the proposed change, saying that it would “damage the image of our clubs and our league”. He went on to say that Ligue1 clubs “depend on casino revenues” and that any reduction in those revenues would have a negative impact on their operations.</p>
<h1 id="French-Ligue1-Casinos-File-Protest-Over-Elimination-of-Gambling-Loss-Deduction"><a href="#French-Ligue1-Casinos-File-Protest-Over-Elimination-of-Gambling-Loss-Deduction" class="headerlink" title="French Ligue1 Casinos File Protest Over Elimination of Gambling Loss Deduction"></a>French Ligue1 Casinos File Protest Over Elimination of Gambling Loss Deduction</h1><p>A coalition of French Ligue1 casinos, led by the Casino de Paris, has filed a protest with the government over the elimination of gambling loss deductions from individual income tax returns. The new measure, which went into effect on January 1st, is expected to cost the casinos millions in lost revenue.</p>
<p>The casinos are asking for the measure to be overturned, or at least for a grace period to allow them time to adjust. They argue that the measure will have a negative impact on their businesses and employees, as well as on tourism in France.</p>
<p>The French government has defended the measure, stating that it is necessary to protect consumers and prevent addiction. It maintains that gambling losses should not be considered a business expense and should not be deducted from taxable income.</p>
<p>The casino industry is an important contributor to the French economy, accounting for hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of euros in revenue each year. There are currently around 190 casinos in France, most of which are operated by local municipalities.</p>
