Each class has its own unique abilities that can be used in battle.</p>
<p>Once you have created your character, you will need to start building your stronghold. The first thing you need to do is construct a tower by selecting the build tab at the bottom of the screen. You will then need to select what type of tower you want to construct and purchase the required materials using gold coins. Once the tower has been constructed, you can start adding rooms and defences using the same process.</p>
<p>The final step is to attack other players’ strongholds and steal their gold coins. In order to do this, you will need to first locate their stronghold on the map. You can then select it and attempt a siege against it. If successful, you will be able to steal their gold coins and build up your own stronghold even further!</p>
