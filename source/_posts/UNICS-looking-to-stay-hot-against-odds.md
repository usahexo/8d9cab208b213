#  UNICS looking to stay hot against odds

Last time out, UNICS Koszalin showed they weren’t pushovers, taking down teams like Anwil Wloclawek and CSKA Moscow on the road. With an overall record of 10-8, the club is currently in seventh place in the standings. And while a playoff berth is still in reach, they’ll need to keep up the good work if they hope to make it past teams like Olympiacos Piraeus and Real Madrid.

Fortunately for UNICS, their next matchup should be a bit easier as they go up against Khimki Moscow Region. The home side is currently sporting a 12-6 record, but sits in only fourth place in the standings thanks to some lackluster performances against weaker opponents. With that being said, Khimki will be looking to bounce back after two consecutive defeats and should provide a stiff test for UNICS.

If the away side can manage to come away with another victory then they’ll be one step closer to securing a playoff spot. However, any slip-ups could see them fall behind other clubs in the race for postseason berths.

#  UNICS faces uphill battle against odds

 
The UNICS team is in for a battle as they face up against some of the best teams in Europe. With odds stacked against them, they will have to work hard and play smart if they want to come out on top.

UNICS has had a strong start to their season, but they will need to be careful not to get complacent. They have already beaten some of the top teams in Europe, but there are many more challenges ahead.

There are a few teams that could give UNICS trouble. CSKA Moscow is always a contender, and Fenerbahce Ulker is looking strong this season. The Turkish team has already beaten UNICS this year, so they will be looking for revenge.

Other teams to watch out for include Olympiacos Piraeus and Bayern Munich. These squads are packed with talent, and they will be difficult to beat. However, UNICS has proved that they can compete with the best of them, so there is no reason to count them out just yet.

With some tough matchups ahead, the UNICS team faces an uphill battle. However, if they play together and utilize their strengths, they have a good chance of coming out on top.

#  UNICS looks to cover odds in matchup

After starting the season with an inconsistent 2-4 record, UNICS Kazan looks to cover the odds in their matchup against Khimki Moscow Region.

Led by head coach Dimitris Itoudis, UNICS has been one of the EuroLeague’s best defensive teams this season, allowing just 83.8 points per 100 possessions. That stingy defense will be put to the test against a Khimki squad that is averaging 94.7 points per game this season.

While UNICS has been stout defensively, they have struggled offensively, averaging just 81.8 points per game this season. That offensive ineptitude was on full display in their most recent matchup against Barcelona, as they were held to just 62 points on 36% shooting from the field.

To win this matchup, UNICS will need to get consistent scoring from their trio of guards — Vitaly Fridzon, Dmitry Kulagin and Quincy Miller. If those three can score in double figures, it will go a long way in helping UNICS cover the spread.

On the other side, Khimki will need their big three of Alexey Shved, Anthony Gill and Timofey Mozgov to carry them offensively. Shved and Gill have been especially effective this season, averaging a combined 37 points per game. If they can continue to play at a high level, Khimki should be able to come away with a win in this matchup.

#  UNICS seeks to topple favorites in betting odds

In the upcoming Russian Cup, UNICS Kazan is seeking to overthrow favorites CSKA Moscow and Lokomotiv Kuban in betting odds, according to international sports news outlet Betway.

UNICS, who finished runners-up in the VTB United League Playoffs this year, come into the tournament as 6/1 outsiders - a price that will surely shorten if they can get off to a good start. CSKA are unsurprisingly favourites at 1/7, while Lokomotiv are priced at 5/2.

UNICS will have to do without injured forward Quincy Miller this time around, but they have still got plenty of firepower up front with Keith Langford and Vitaly Fridzon. They will also be relying on captain Artsiom Parakhouski in the paint. The big Belarusian has been superb for UNICS recently, averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds per game in their playoff run.

CSKA have their own injury concerns ahead of the tournament with Nando De Colo still sidelined. However, they have several other stars including Sergio Rodriguez and Will Clyburn who are more than capable of leading them to victory.

#  UNICS aims to defy expectations versus spread

In the Russian Premier League, UNICS Kazan will go up against FC Khimki. The home side is a sizable favorite, as Khimki come in with a 5-11 record on the season. UNICS, meanwhile, has put together an impressive 11-3 mark.

But records don't always tell the whole story, and UNICS will look to defy expectations by picking up a win on the road in this matchup. They come into this contest having won six of their last seven games, and they'll have plenty of confidence heading into Saturday's matchup.

Khimki has been solid defensively this season, but their offense has been suspect. That could be a recipe for disaster against UNICS, as the visitors are averaging 85 points per game this season.

It should be an interesting contest between these two teams, and UNICS certainly has what it takes to pull off the upset victory on Saturday.
