#  Westgate casino confirmed as a new Ligue1 sponsor 

On the heels of their acquisition of Neymar, French Ligue1 side Paris Saint-Germain has announced a new sponsorship deal with Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino. The deal is said to be for 3 years and will see the casino become the club’s official gaming partner.

The partnership will see Westgate become the presenting sponsor of PSG’s pre-season matches in North America as well as having a strong branding presence at the club’s home ground, Parc des Princes.

This is not the first time that PSG have teamed up with a casino, with their former sponsors being online gambling giant Betclic. However, this is said to be one of the biggest sponsorship deals ever signed by a French football club.

Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino is no stranger to sport, with them previously having sponsorship deals in place with NBA sides Miami Heat and Orlando Magic, as well as MLS side LA Galaxy.

#  Casino uses sport to increase brand awareness 

The casino industry is a multi-billion dollar business, and casinos are always looking for new and innovative ways to increase brand awareness. One way that casinos are doing this is by using sport.

Casinos have been sponsoring sporting events for many years, but in recent years they have started to use social media to connect with fans. In addition to sponsoring major sporting events, casinos are also starting to sponsor individual athletes.

One example of this is the sponsorship deal that the Wynn casino in Las Vegas struck with boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather. The casino paid Mayweather $7 million to wear their logo during his fight against Marcos Maidana in May 2014.

Another example is the sponsorship deal between the Venetian casino in Las Vegas and the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). The Venetian was the first casino to sponsor a UFC event, and they have continued to sponsor UFC events ever since.

Casinos are also using social media to connect with fans of sport. One example of this is the sponsorship deal between MGM Resorts and the Los Angeles Kings. As part of this deal, MGM Resorts has become the official casino of the Kings. They have also created a website called KINGS360 which features exclusive content about the Kings.

Casinos understand that sports fans are passionate about their teams and their sport, and they are using this passion to increase brand awareness. By sponsoring major sporting events and individual athletes, as well as creating websites and content specifically about sports, casinos are able to reach out to sports fans all over the world.

#  Ligue1 side entice Westgate casino as a new major sponsor 

Ligue 1 side AS Monaco Football Club has announced a new partnership with the Westgate casino in Las Vegas. The deal is reportedly worth around €15 million per year and will see the casino become the club’s new major sponsor.

The deal is seen as a coup for the Ligue 1 side, who have been looking for a new major sponsor since their deal with French telecoms company Orange ended last year. The sponsorship will run for three years and will see the casino’s name and logo appear on the front of Monaco’s shirts from next season.

Westgate casino is one of the biggest casinos in the world and is owned by American billionaire Mark Cuban. The casino is well known for its poker tournaments and attracts thousands of players every year.

Monaco’s vice-president Vadim Vasilyev was delighted to have secured the deal, telling reporters that “this is a very important day for our club. We are proud to be associated with such a prestigious casino.”

The sponsorship is a major boost for Monaco, who finished 5th in Ligue 1 last season and will be looking to improve on that this year. The club has already made some big signings this summer, including Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Lemar and Brazilian striker Keita Balde Diao.

#  French football welcomes new sponsor for the Ligue1 season 

Ligue 1 football club AS Monaco has agreed a three-year sponsorship deal with French car manufacturer Renault. The deal is said to be worth a total of €60 million, and will see the Ligue1 title renamed as the “Renault Ligue 1” from the upcoming season.

This new partnership is a big win for both Renault and Monaco, with each party set to benefit hugely from the agreement. For Renault, this marks their biggest ever sponsorship deal in France, and provides a significant marketing opportunity to increase awareness of their brand amongst French football fans.

For Monaco, the money from this deal will help to finance their ambitious plans for redevelopment, with the club looking to move to a new stadium and increase their playing staff. The arrival of such high-profile players as Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez in recent years has helped to raise the profile of Monaco both domestically and internationally, and they will be looking to continue this trend with the help of their new sponsors.

The Renault Ligue 1 is sure to be an exciting competition this season, with several teams looking capable of lifting the trophy. AS Monaco will be among the favourites for the title, but they will face stiff competition from rivals Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lyon. Whatever happens, it should be another fascinating season in French football, and we can look forward to seeing some great matches between some of Europe’s top teams.

#  Westgate casino announced as title sponsor for Ligue1

The Westgate casino has today been announced as the title sponsor for Ligue1, the top division of French football.

This is a landmark deal for both parties, with the casino gaining significant exposure in one of Europe's top football leagues, and Ligue1 gaining an important financial boost.

Westgate casino is a major Las Vegas institution and it is hoped that this sponsorship will help to raise its profile outside of the US.

Ligue1 is one of the most watched football leagues in the world, with a global audience of around 4 billion. The league is home to some of the biggest clubs in European football, including Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco and Marseille.

Westgate casino is no stranger to sponsoring sporting events, having previously been involved in NASCAR and IndyCar racing. This is its first foray into European football though, and it is hoped that the relationship will be a long and fruitful one.
