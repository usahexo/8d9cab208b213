#  What is black jack?

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

The game begins with each player being given two cards. The player then has the option to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). The dealer will then give themselves two cards, and also has the option to hit or stand.

If the player's total equals 21, they win straight away - this is called a blackjack. If the dealer goes over 21, all players still in the game win automatically. If both players have 21 but with different suits, the hand is a draw and nobody wins or loses anything.

If the player's total is higher than the dealer's total but lower than 21, they can choose to take more cards in an attempt to reach 21. If their total equals or exceeds 21 after taking more cards, they lose their bet. If the dealer goes bust (has a total of 22 or more), all players still in the game win automatically.

The basic mathematics of blackjack are simple: you want to get as close to 21 as you can without going over, and beat whatever number the dealer has. Cards 2-10 are worth face value, Aces can be either 1 or 11 (player's choice), and Kings, Queens and Jacks are all worth 10 points each.

# What are the rules of blackjack?

Blackjack is a game that has simple rules, but offers players the chance to win big payouts. The following are the basic rules of blackjack:

* To play blackjack, you will need a deck of 52 cards.
Dealing begins with the player to the dealers left and proceeds clockwise.
Each player is dealt two cards face up, the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down. 
The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 (a blackjack), or by drawing cards that total closer to 21 than the dealer does. 
You can also win if the dealer busts (goes over 21).
If you have two cards of equal value, such as two 8s, you can split them into two separate hands. 
You can also double your bet if you are feeling confident about your hand.
Cards values are: 2 through 10 are worth their face value; Jack, Queen and King are worth 10 each; an Ace can be 1 or 11.


The basic playing strategy for blackjack is to always hit on 16 or less, stand on 17 or more, double down on 11 or more, split pairs when possible and never take insurance.
