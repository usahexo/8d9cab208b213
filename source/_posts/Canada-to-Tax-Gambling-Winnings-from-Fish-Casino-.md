#  Canada to Tax Gambling Winnings from Fish Casino 

The Canadian government is planning to tax gambling winnings from the Fish Casino app, which has become popular among players in the country. Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said that the government will start taxing such winnings at the end of this month.

According to Lebouthillier, players who win more than CA$10 (US$7.68) from the Fish Casino app will have to pay taxes on their earnings. The new tax regime will apply to all residents of Canada, including those living outside of the country.

Lebouthillier did not say how much money the government expects to collect from the new tax. However, she noted that the measure is aimed at ensuring "that everyone pays their fair share."

The Fish Casino app allows players to bet on a variety of simulated casino games, including slots, blackjack, and poker. It has become increasingly popular in Canada in recent months, with many people using it to gamble online.

Gambling winnings are currently not subject to taxation in Canada. However, the government says that it is seeking to levy taxes on such winnings as part of its efforts to crack down on tax evasion and avoidance.

#  India Mulls Taxing Gambling Winnings from Fish Casino 

Gambling in India is a popular pastime, but the government is considering taxing gambling winnings from an unusual source: the country's new "fish casino."

Earlier this year, a fish farmer in the southern state of Kerala created a slot machine for fish using empty Coca Cola bottles. He filled the bottles with water and placed small fish inside. When a customer pulled the bottle's lever, the fish would swim around and sometimes land inside one of five cups at the top of the bottle. If the customer guessed correctly which cup held the fish, they would win money from a prize pool.

A group of entrepreneurs saw potential in the game and opened a real-life casino version called "Fish Farm." The casino has been a huge success, drawing in gamblers from all over India. Now, the government is considering taxing gambling winnings from Fish Farm as part of its efforts to increase tax revenue.

Some people are opposed to taxing Fish Farm winnings, arguing that it is unfair to tax gamblers twice (once when they gamble, and again when they win). Others argue that taxing Fish Farm winnings is a good way to generate additional revenue for the government. What do you think?

#  China Plans to Tax Gambling Winnings from Fish Casino 

China is getting serious about its crackdown on gambling. The country’s lawmakers are proposing to tax gambling winnings from online Fish Casino games.

The proposed new law, which is currently being reviewed by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, would levy a 20 per cent tax on any winnings above 10,000 yuan (US$1,500).

This latest move is part of a wider effort by the Chinese government to address illegal gambling activities. In recent months, Beijing has been tightening its grip on the online gambling market, and has ordered internet companies to shut down a number of illegal casino and betting websites.

Fish Casino games are particularly popular in China, with players using their smartphones to bet on virtual fish swimming around in digital tanks. The games are available in a number of languages, including Mandarin and English, and offer a range of betting options, from just a few cents to several hundred dollars.

Online gambling is big business in China, with estimates putting the market value at around US$38 billion annually. And while most of this activity is illegal, there is no doubt that the proposed new tax will have a major impact on the industry.

Players responded to news of the proposed new tax with mixed reactions. Some welcomed the move as it would help to legitimize the Fish Casino industry and ensure that players receive their winnings fairly. Others were concerned that it would lead to an increase in black market activity and reduced profits for legitimate operators.

#  Australia to Tax Gambling Winnings from Fish Casino 

The Australian government is planning to introduce a new tax on gambling winnings from offshore casinos. The new tax will be aimed at high-rollers who win big sums of money while playing at so-called Fish Casino websites.

Under the proposed plan, gamblers who win more than AU$1,000 while playing at offshore casinos will be required to pay a 10 percent tax on their winnings. The new tax is expected to generate an additional AU$2 million in revenue for the government each year.

The move comes as the government ramps up efforts to crack down on illegal gambling activity. Last year, the government introduced a new law that requires online casinos operating in Australia to obtain a license from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).

Offshore casinos have been quick to criticize the proposed tax, with one representative describing it as "discriminatory" and "punitive." However, the government has argued that the new tax is necessary in order to protect Australian consumers and ensure that gambling proceeds are taxed fairly.

#  New Zealand to Tax Gambling Winnings from Fish Casino

The New Zealand government announced a new tax on gambling winnings from the Fish Casino, a popular online gaming site. The new tax will apply to all winnings above NZ$1,000 and is expected to raise around NZ$3 million in revenue each year.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash said the new tax is aimed at ensuring that gambling profits are shared fairly among all New Zealanders. "It's only fair that people who lose money gambling shoulder some of the cost of providing these services, as well as those who make money from it," he said.

The new tax will apply to both New Zealand residents and foreigners, and will be collected by the Inland Revenue Department. Gambling winnings are currently taxed at a rate of 28%, and the new tax will add an additional 10% to that rate.

The Fish Casino has been operating in New Zealand since 2016, and has proved to be extremely popular with players. The site offers a range of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as a wide range of slot machines. The site is licensed and regulated by the New Zealand Gambling Commission.
