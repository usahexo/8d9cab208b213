#  Master The Art Of 3 Card Poker With These Tips!

3 card poker is now one of the most popular casino table games. It is quick, easy to learn and fun. Many people enjoy the challenge of trying to beat the dealer.

There are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning at 3 card poker:

#1 – Know The Odds

In any casino game, it is important to understand the odds. The better you understand the probabilities, the more informed your decisions will be. In 3 card poker, there are three possible outcomes for each hand: win, lose or tie. There are also three betting options: pair plus, ante and raise. The odds of each outcome are as follows:

Win: 36%
Pair Plus: 36%
Ante: 24%
Raise: 4%
Tie: 10%

Knowing these odds will help you make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. For instance, if you believe that there is a good chance that your opponent has a higher-ranked hand than you do, it might be wise to fold rather than risk losing more money.

#2 – Play With A Strategy
Just like any other casino game, playing 3 card poker with a strategy will give you a better chance of winning. There are many different strategies out there, but here is one example: always raise if you have a pair or better; otherwise, raise only if the dealer’s upcard is two or less. This strategy gives you the best chance of winning against the dealer’s hand. Of course, you can always adjust your strategy depending on what cards are shown and how much money you have left in your bankroll.

#3 – Use Bonuses To Your AdvantageOne great way to increase your chances of winning at 3 card poker is to take advantage of casino bonuses. Most online casinos offer welcome bonuses for new players, which can give you extra cash to play with. Make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting any bonus offers; some bonuses have very restrictive wagering requirements which must be met before any winnings can be withdrawn.

Once you have a basic understanding of which hands beat which, you can start incorporating that knowledge into your gameplay strategy. Here are some tips for how to play different types of hands in order to maximize your chances of winning: 

       

Pair - When you are dealt a pair, it is usually best to just call or raise with intention to see the next card or two in order for your hand to improve. If you hit two Pair or better on the turn or river, then you should go all-in if there is enough money in the pot.

     Two Pair - When you are dealt Two Pair, it is usually best to raise or go all-in since you have already made a strong hand.

    Three Of A Kind - When you are dealt Three Of A Kind, it is usually best either to raise or go all-in depending on how much money is in the pot and how many opponents you have left to act after you..

Straight - When you are dealt Straight, it is usually best just call or raise in order to see if someone has anything better than Ace high (which would beat your Straight). If someone does indeed have something better than Ace high, then they will likely bet and at that point you can decide whether or not to fold your hand.

Flush - When you are dealt Flush, it is usually best either just call or raise based on how much money is in the pot and how many opponents remain active.. As with any hand, however, always use your best judgement and be willing to fold if necessary..

Full House - When you are dealt Full House, it is usually best either just call or raise based on how much money is in pot and how many opponents remain active.. Again, always use your best judgement and be willing to fold if necessary..
