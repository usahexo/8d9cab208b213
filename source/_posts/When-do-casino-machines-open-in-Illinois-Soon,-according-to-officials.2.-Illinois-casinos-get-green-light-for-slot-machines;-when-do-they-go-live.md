The long wait is almost over Illinois residents as the state’s first floating casino is set to open its doors to the public on November 21. Slot machines are expected to go live at that time and some lucky gamers could walk away with millions of dollars in prize money.

It is a mammoth structure that is longer than two football fields and will have more than 1,200 slot machines on board. There will also be a range of other casino games available, including poker, blackjack, and roulette.

The casino will be permanently docked at Clinton Lake and will cater to gamers from Missouri and Kansas as well as Illinois residents. The Emerald Queen Casino is one of four casinos that were awarded licenses by the state of Illinois in February this year.

Two of the other casinos are also floating casinos, while the fourth is on dry land. All four are expected to open in the next few months, with the final one scheduled to open in December. The introduction of these casinos is expected to create around 2,500 jobs in Illinois and generate around $300 million in revenue each year.

Gamers in Illinois have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Emerald Queen Casino since it was announced earlier this year. The excitement has been building ever since and many people are already making plans to visit the casino when it opens later this month.
