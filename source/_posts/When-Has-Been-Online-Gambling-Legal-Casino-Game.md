#  When Has Been Online Gambling Legal Casino Game?

Casino games have been around for centuries, with the first recorded casino opening in Venice, Italy in 1638. But when did online gambling become legal?

The first online casino opened in 1994, but it was not until 1998 that the first online poker room opened. At that time, online gambling was still a bit of a grey area, with no real regulation in place.

However, in 2001 the US Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which made it illegal for banks and financial institutions to process transactions related to online gambling. This effectively shut down the American online gambling market.

But other countries soon began to legalize and regulate online gambling, and over time the industry has continued to grow. In 2016, global revenue from online gambling was estimated at $41.5 billion.

So what are the current laws around online gambling?

In most countries, online gambling is legal as long as it is done within the confines of that country’s regulations. For example, in Australia online casinos must be licensed by the state government, and players must be over 18 years of age. In the UK, there are a number of regulatory bodies that oversee different aspects of online gambling, such as slots and casino games. And in Canada, players can only gamble at sites that are licensed and regulated by the government.

There are a few countries where online gambling is not legal. These include France, Turkey, and South Korea. But even in these countries there is usually some form of unofficial or black market gambling available.

#  The Most Trusted Guide to Legal Online Gambling

In the last decade, online gambling has become one of the most popular online activities. According to a study by The European Gaming and Betting Association, in 2017, Europeans spent €24.7 billion on online gambling, with sport betting accounting for the majority of this spending (€19.3 billion).

This has created a huge market for both licensed and unlicensed operators. Unlicensed operators are often less scrupulous when it comes to protecting player funds and meeting regulatory requirements. So, how do you know which operators are safe and trustworthy?

In this article, we provide a guide to safe and legal online gambling in Europe. We cover how to choose a regulated operator, what protections are available to players, and the best ways to stay safe while gambling online.

## Choosing a Regulated Operator

When looking for a safe and reputable online gambling operator, it is important to choose one that is licensed and regulated by an appropriate authority. In Europe, there are a number of gaming regulators which oversee different types of gambling activity. For example, the UK Gambling Commission oversees land-based and online casinos, sports betting, bingo, lotteries, and amusement arcades; while the Malta Gaming Authority regulates casino games, sports betting, poker tournaments, as well as bingo and lottery providers.

You can check an operator’s licensing status on their website or on gaming regulator websites such as Casinomeister (for UK operators) or GambleAware (for operators licensed in Malta). Licensed operators must meet rigorous standards set by their regulatory authority, including ensuring player funds are protected in case of insolvency. They also typically have 24/7 customer support and complaints procedures in place.

Unlicensed operators may still be legitimate businesses but it is important to be aware that they are not subject to the same regulations as licensed operators. This means that they may not have robust safety measures in place to protect your funds or personal data. In addition, if something goes wrong - for example if the site closes down with player funds still outstanding - you may not be able to get your money back.

So when choosing an online gambling site make sure you always check that it is licensed and regulated by an appropriate authority.

## Protected by Law

In addition to licensing requirements, European gambling law provides a number of protections for players. These include: consumer rights laws; requirements that operators must provide information about risks associated with gambling; bans on advertising gambing services to minors; and rules against unfair terms and conditions.

For example, under UK law , players have certain consumer rights which must be protected by operators . These include the right: to receive clear information about any fees or charges before signing up; to withdraw any unused funds from their account at any time; to change their mind about a bet once it has been placed; and to receive help if they develop a problem with gambling . UK law also requires operators to display risk warnings about gambling on their websites . These warnings inform players about the potential dangers associated with gambling such as getting into debt or developing a addiction .
