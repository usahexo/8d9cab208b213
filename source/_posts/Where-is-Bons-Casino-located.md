# What football team does Bons Casino support?

This is a question that often comes up for those who are interested in gambling and want to know which team Bons Casino backs. Unfortunately, the answer is not straightforward, as the casino does not have an official policy on this matter. 

That said, there is some speculation among industry insiders that Bons Casino may be sympathetic to Portuguese club Benfica. This theory is based on the fact that the casino’s founder, Ricardo Bón society, is a longtime fan of the team. 

However, there is no definitive proof of this link and it should be noted that Bons Casino also sponsors other teams, such as Spanish side Valencia and Italian club AC Milan. So it’s hard to say for sure which team the company supports. 

What we can say for certain, though, is that Bons Casino is a reputable and reliable operator that offers great games and bonuses to its players. So if you’re looking for a trusted place to gamble online, then this site should definitely be at the top of your list.

Ligue 1 is the top division of French football. It was founded in 1932 and is made up of 20 teams. The most successful club in the league's history is Paris Saint-Germain, who have won the title 34 times.

# Who are the current Ligue1 champions?

The current Ligue1 champions are Paris Saint-Germain. They have won the league six times in a row and show no signs of slowing down. This season, they are on track to make it a seventh title in a row.

Of course, PSG is not alone at the top of the table. There are several other teams that are capable of winning the league, including Lyon, Marseille, and Monaco. However, PSG has been by far the dominant force in Ligue1 over the past few years.

What makes them so successful? What sets them apart from the competition?

There are several factors that have contributed to PSG’s dominance. Their financial resources are certainly a major advantage – they have one of the biggest budgets in world football. But money is not everything; PSG has also been blessed with some very talented players over the years.

Neymar, Kylian Mbappé, and Edinson Cavani are just a few of the stars who have played for PSG in recent years. These players have helped to make PSG one of the most exciting teams to watch in Europe. They always seem to be scoring goals and making things happen on the pitch.

And let’s not forget about manager Thomas Tuchel. He has done an excellent job in leading PSG to success over the past two seasons. He has instilled a winning mentality within the team and seems to get the best out of his players week after week.

It will be interesting to see how PSG performs in the Champions League this year. They were knocked out in humiliating fashion by Manchester United last season, but they will be hoping for a better result this time around. Neymar and company will be looking to go all the way and win Europe’s top prize.

In any case, there is no doubt that PSG is currently one of Europe’s elite clubs and is poised for continued success in the years ahead.
