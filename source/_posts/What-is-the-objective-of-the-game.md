#  What is the objective of the game?

Poker is a card game that is typically played for money. The objective of the game is to have the best five-card poker hand at the end of the hand.

# How do you play?

There are a number of different variations of poker, but all involve 52 cards. The basic game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. There are also jokers, which are not used in most versions of poker. Each player is dealt five cards, face down. After all players have been dealt their cards, the first player to act is the one who was dealt the best hand, and he or she has three options:

1) Bet: Betting allows players to wager money against their opponents. This can be done by placing chips in the middle of the table or by stating how much money they want to wager. When betting, players must either match the amount that has already been wagered or raise it; they cannot re-raise.

2) Check: Checking allows players to stay in the hand without betting any money. If all other players check as well, then no one bets and the next card is turned over. This is called a "flop."

3) Fold: If a player does not like their hand, they can fold and bow out of the hand. They will lose any money they have currently bet, but will not lose any more money unless they are forced to put in more money (see " showdown").

#  What are the odds?

People often ask each other, "What are the odds?" whether it's about the weather, a game or some other event. Odds can be calculated in different ways for different events, but there is always a chance of something happening.

The probability of something happening is what we use to calculate odds. The probability of an event is how likely that event is to occur. We can use a formula to calculate the probability of an event. The formula is:

P(Event) = 
__ 
__ 
__ where: 
P(Event) = Probability of Event 
x = number of favourable outcomes 
n = total number of outcomes possible

For example, if you toss a coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails. So, n = 2. If you flip the coin twice, there are four possible outcomes: HH, HT, TT, and TH. So x = 4. Plugging these values into the equation above gives us P(HH) = 1/4 and P(TT) = 1/4.

Some events have more than two possible outcomes. For example, when rolling a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So n = 6 and x = 6. This time P(1) = 1/6, P(2) = 2/6, and so on up to P(6) = 1/6 again. Notice that adding together all the probabilities for all the individual outcomes will always equal 1 (or 100% if expressed as a percentage), because there are only six possibilities and they all have to happen individually at some point!

Now let's look at an event with multiple favourable outcomes. Suppose you're flipping two coins at once and want to know the probability of getting two heads (HH). To figure this out we need to use the factorial function. The factorial function is written as ! and is pronounced "factorial." It calculates how many different ways you can arrange a set of objects given that order doesn't matter. So for example 3! would be 3x2x1 or 6 because you can have 3 items arranged in six different ways (3!=3x2x1). In this case n would be 2 (since we're dealing with two coins) and x would be 2 (since we're looking for two heads). This gives us P(HH) = 2!/2x1!=1/4. As expected, this is the same as our earlier calculation using just algebraic methods.

Not all events have a calculable probability though! For example, if I asked you what are the odds of aliens landing on earth tomorrow morning you probably couldn't give me an answer (although I'd love to hear your guess!). That's because there is no known data with which to calculate a probability for such an unlikely event! However unlikely an event may be though doesn't mean it can't happen- it's just that we don't know how likely it is.

#  What are the best hands?

One of the most common questions that beginning poker players ask is “What are the best hands?”

There is no easy answer to this question. It depends on a variety of factors, including the poker variant you are playing, the stakes, and your opponent’s playing style.

Nonetheless, there are some hands that are generally considered to be stronger than others. We’ve listed some of the most powerful hands below.

# Ace-Queen (AQ)

The Ace-Queen combination is often referred to as a “big slick” or “Ace-King suited.” It is a strong hand in nearly all variants of poker. In particular, it is a strong hand in No-Limit Texas Hold’em.

This hand has good potential for both making a high pair and also for hitting a flush or straight draw. As such, it is often played aggressively preflop.

# Ace-King (AK)

The Ace-King combination is another powerful hand in nearly all variants of poker. It ranks just below the Ace-Queen combination in terms of strength. This hand can make either a high pair or a straight/flush draw.

Like the Ace-Queen combination, it is often played aggressively preflop.

#  When do you get a 3 card poker bonus?

There are a few things you need to know about 3 card poker bonuses before you can start claiming them. Let's take a look at some of the most important questions and answers related to this type of bonus.

【1】How Do I Know If a Casino Offers 3 Card Poker Bonus?
 
The best way to find out if a casino offers a 3 card poker bonus is to check their website or contact customer support. Most casinos will have this information readily available, but if they don't then you can always contact them and ask.

【2】What Kind of Requirements Must I Meet To Earn the Bonus?

However, be sure to read the terms and conditions of each bonus offer carefully as there may be specific requirements that must be met in order to qualify for the bonus.

【3】How Much Money Can I Expect To Get From the Bonus? 
This really depends on the casino that you choose as well as the size of the bonus offered. Typically, the bonuses range from $50 to $500, but there may be some that offer more or less depending on the casino. Be sure to do your research before settling on a particular casino so that you know what kind of bonus they offer.

#  If I have two pair, what is my payout?

If you have two pair, your payout is determined by the rank of your two pairs. The highest ranking pair is the one that matters. So, if you have two pair, Aces and 2s, your payout would be based on the rank of your two aces. If you have two pair, 10s and 6s, your payout would be based on the rank of your two tens.
